;; Before running Git, Magit by default reverts all unmodified
;; buffers that visit files tracked in the current repository.
;; This can potentially lead to data loss, so you might want to
;; disable this by adding the following line to your init file:

;; (setq magit-auto-revert-mode nil)

(setq magit-last-seen-setup-instructions "1.4.0")
